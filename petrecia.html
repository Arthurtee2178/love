      Being in love is an all-consuming experience...<br>
      Being in love is an all-consuming experience. It is exciting, thrilling, and a little terrifying to fall head over heels for someone. The passion between two people deeply in love burns like a wildfire. They only have eyes for each other, and everything else pales in comparison. Passion for a lover is expressed physically, but it can also be a strong emotional connection. The bond between two people madly in love with each other is not easily broken. It an intense and powerful force. Falling in love may one of the greatest feelings ever. There is an actual chemical process that happens to a person who is falling in love. All of the senses have a greater intensity. Colors seem brighter, sounds more resonant and smells more powerful when you are newly in love. When you are with your lover there is no greater feeling in the world, and when you're not you spend all your time thinking of each other. New love is truly an awesome feeling.
