    <h1>Masha ❤</h1>
    <h2>Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds</h2>
    <p>
      Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
      Admit impediments; love is not love<br>
      Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
      Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
      O no, it is an ever-fixèd mark<br>
      That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
      It is the star to every wand'ring bark<br>
      Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
      Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
      Within his bending sickle's compass come.<br>
      Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
      But bears it out even to the edge of doom:<br>
      If this be error and upon me proved,<br>
      I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
