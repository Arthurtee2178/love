    <div class="letter">
      <p>Hello, my love.</p>

      <p>How are you? This is an exciting letter I am writing with my blood. Today I felt inspired to write to you — perhaps I'm listening to a soft, romantic playlist or the air is simply right and you are the first thing on my mind. A few years ago I would have thought love lived only in poems and songs; now my heart knows what love truly entails.</p>

      <p>I have grown older and learned that love is more than words. I am writing this letter with the ink of my heart because you are my best part. I cannot wait to look upon you and see the glory shining from your face — it will be an emotional moment I will stand still to experience.</p>

      <p>In today's chaotic world, please know I will be devoted and committed to you. Every day I will lift your spirit through prayer, and I will fight for you on my knees so that when you stand, nothing will make you fall. You are so strong; your tenacity inspires everyone you meet, and that is why I fall in love with you again each day.</p>

      <p>You are mine — not to own, but to cherish. You are perfect as you are. If anything needs to change, you will decide it for yourself. You are my lover and my confidante. The little things you do, like smiling at me and patting my back, keep me going.</p>

      <p>We will delight in food and new recipes, cook and laugh together. When you are with me, time stands still. Hold this letter close — I have written it with the best ink in the world: my love. I love you.</p>

      <p>Yours always,<br>
      — &lt;Bear&gt;</p>
